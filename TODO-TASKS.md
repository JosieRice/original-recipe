# Things left to do in some kind of order

1. Get the vercel preview environment to direct to the right place (something with env variables).
2. Setup a different query for top 10 recipes when logged out and for first 10 recipes for user when logged in.
3. Setup pagination of recipes.
4. Setup a separate db for local development.
5. Figure out how to upload recipe pics.
